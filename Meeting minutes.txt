First Meet- 30th August 2022:
• Digital elecs project
• To do ninja game with hardware modelling
• Other than remote we will make all hardware
• Verilog is important 
• Schematic,figures etc will be given
• We will have a 2 dimensional plane
• We will have coordinates where fruit pops and using origin and coordinates we will check angle at which fruit pops
• These coordinates should be selected using random number
• We have a random generator in hardware
• We need to make random generator, graphic design and remote for slicing
• Project plan
1. Start the game
2. Game rules and play-includes design of bomb and fruit, launch of fruit,when to stop or call game over etc
3. Timer
4. Graphics
5. Remote
6. End
• Advancements can be done at last
• We have gyroscope and two ICs to create a remote
• Remote description pdf will be shared
• FPGA is not so easy like simulation...Limitations are present when compared to software simulation
• Plan is to finish by end of sem
• Design for FPGA includes 
1. simulation
2. synthesis
3. Implementation
4. Bit stream generation
• Download VIVADO for FPGA which is software to upload code in FPGA of Xilinx company
• Offline meet to have discussion on happened things
• Things to do:
1. Digital logic design
2. Verilog
• Use morris mano for preparing these topics
• Share ur github ids to mentors

Meeting on 9th September 2022:
• Complete combination logic till Tuesday.
• Solve questions that will be posted on group from Wed. We will then implement them in verilog.
• In next week, we will be directly writing verilog codes in meets.
• Implement some circuits in eda playground to get familiar with verilog.
• Familiarise yourself with verilog playlist shared in group.
• You can solve verilog assignment questions from cepstrum EE210 course.
• Try to learn pushing request in Github repos
• Random number generator concept
• Pseudo generator just uses shifting and using xor of inputs

Meeting on 27th September 2022:
• Complete combinational and sequential logic during midsem break.
• Solve a few verilog questions as well during the midsem break.
• Implement some circuits in eda playground to get familiar with verilog.
• Familiarise yourself with verilog playlist shared in group.
• You can solve verilog assignment questions from cepstrum EE210 course.
• Random number generator concept shall be dealt with following the midsem break.
• Pseudo generator just uses shifting and using xor of inputs
